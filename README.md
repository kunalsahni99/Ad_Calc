# Ad_Calc
Basic, Scientific calculator with extra functionalities, such as Matrix operations, Limit, Mathematical series etc.

## 1. Basic Calculator
This includes the basic numpad with basic arithmetic operations **(ie., +, -, x, รท, .)** etc.

### Features:

(a) Here, we have added **Text-field** and **Real time update** to give efficiency to calculator.

(b) Next is **A/B** toggle button which is used to switch between *A/B* form to a decimal form and vice versa.

  (i) When the button is **ON** :

## 2. Scientific Calculator:
This includes basic trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic operations.

## 3. Matrix:
Certain basic operations on matrices such as **addition (A+B), subtraction (A-B), multiplication (A.B), Inverse** etc. can be done using this app.
